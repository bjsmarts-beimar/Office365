Developers can implement Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) controls to completely alter how fields, 
views or other form-based objects operate. And, because they leverage modern web tools/languages, it is easy 
to get a PCF control deployed out into the application.

Create a PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) component

initialize a new PCF component
configure a PCF component manifest
implement the component interfaces
package, deploy, and consume the component
use Web API device capabilities and other component framework services

Stepping back into the world of Dynamics CRM for a few seconds, and we can see that our options for modifying 
the out of the box forms (now a central component as part of model-driven apps) are somewhat limited. Although developers 
have a high degree of control over the general layout of a form, our ability to modify how a text field is displayed remains 
virtually non-existent. Instead, developers would have to revert to building out HTML Web Resource files and then embedding 
these within a form instead. 

 Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) controls have advantages they have over traditional Web Resources include:

The ability to bundle all aspects of your project together into a single solution file.
Because the application renders custom controls at the same time as the form itself, 
users get a completely seamless experience when using a model-driven app.
They are developed using modern web technologies, such as NPM, Node.js and TypeScript.
(Eventual) support for all types of Power Apps, both model and canvas.

After this has installed, be sure to go into the Visual Studio 2017 installer and add on the individual component 
NuGet targets & Build Tasks, an additional pre-requisite.
