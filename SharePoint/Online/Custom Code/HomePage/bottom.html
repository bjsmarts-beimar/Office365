Team sites on SharePoint contain data and information related to the day to day business operations of the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
  
Some sites are access restricted and can only be accessed by contacting the site owner for permissions. If you have a SharePoint project related request, your manager must approve and submit a request to the SharePoint Technical Support team. The process can take a few days, so plan ahead .
 
If you have questions or experience problems please send them to sptechsupport@scdhhs.gov .
